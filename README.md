# Progressive Delivery with Argo Rollouts and AI-Powered Analysis

This repository demonstrates progressive delivery on OpenShift using Argo Rollouts with an AI-powered metrics plugin for automated canary analysis. The setup includes a complete GitOps workflow with Argo CD, OpenShift Routes for traffic management, and an autonomous Kubernetes agent that analyzes deployments using AI.

## Overview

The AI metrics plugin integrates with Argo Rollouts to provide intelligent canary analysis. During rollouts, an autonomous agent fetches logs from stable and canary pods, analyzes them using AI models (Gemini or OpenAI), and decides whether to promote or abort the deployment. When issues are detected, the agent can automatically create GitHub issues with detailed diagnostics.

### Architecture

```
Argo Rollouts (with AI plugin) 
    ↓ (A2A protocol)
Kubernetes Agent (Quarkus + LangChain4j)
    ↓ (fetches logs via Kubernetes API)
Application Pods (stable + canary)
```

The plugin delegates all AI operations to the agent, keeping the plugin itself lightweight and focused on metrics collection.

## Prerequisites

- OpenShift cluster v4.10 or later
- [Argo Rollouts kubectl plugin](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/installation/#kubectl-plugin-installation)
- Google API key (for Gemini) or OpenAI API key
- GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope

This setup is designed for testing and demonstration purposes. Do not deploy to production clusters without proper review and hardening.

## Setup

### Fork the Repository

Fork this repository and update the ApplicationSet configurations in [`components/applicationsets`](components/applicationsets) to point to your fork. You'll need to change the `repoURL` fields in both `system-appset.yaml` and `workloads-appset.yaml`.

### Deploy the Stack

Deploy to your OpenShift cluster:

```shell
until oc apply -k bootstrap/overlays/default/; do sleep 15; done
```

This command will retry until successful, as some resources depend on operators being installed first. Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding. The deployment includes:

- OpenShift GitOps (Argo CD)
- Argo Rollouts with AI metrics plugin
- Kubernetes agent for AI analysis
- Sample Quarkus application with canary configuration

### Configure Secrets

After the initial deployment completes and the `openshift-gitops` namespace exists, create the Kubernetes agent secret with your API credentials:

```shell
# Copy the template
cp system/kubernetes-agent/secret.yaml.template system/kubernetes-agent/secret.yaml

# Edit and add your credentials
vim system/kubernetes-agent/secret.yaml
```

Configure your credentials in the secret:

```yaml
stringData:
  # For Gemini (recommended)
  google_api_key: "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
  
  # OR for OpenAI-compatible models:
  openai_api_key: "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
  openai_model: "gpt-4o"
  openai_base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  
  # GitHub token for issue creation
  github_token: "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

**Where to obtain credentials:**
- Google API key: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- OpenAI API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- GitHub token: https://github.com/settings/tokens (requires `repo` scope)

Apply the secret:

```shell
oc apply -f system/kubernetes-agent/secret.yaml
```

The Kubernetes agent will automatically restart and pick up the new credentials.

### Verify Deployment

Check that all components are running:

```shell
# Verify Argo Rollouts
oc get pods -n openshift-gitops | grep argo-rollouts

# Verify Kubernetes agent
oc get pods -n openshift-gitops | grep kubernetes-agent

# Test agent health
oc port-forward -n openshift-gitops svc/kubernetes-agent 8080:8080 &
curl http://localhost:8080/q/health
# Expected: {"status":"UP",...}

# Confirm plugin is loaded
oc logs deployment/argo-rollouts -n openshift-gitops | grep -i "metric-ai"
# Expected: "Successfully loaded plugin: argoproj-labs/metric-ai"
```

### Access the Application

Get the application route URL and open it in your browser:

```shell
export APP_URL=$(oc get route argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo -n argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
firefox https://$APP_URL
```

You should see the sample Quarkus application dashboard showing the current deployment status and rollout information.

## Testing Progressive Delivery

### Trigger a Rollout

Update the application image version in the kustomization file:

```shell
# Example: change from version 1.0.0 to 1.0.1
sed -i 's/1.0.0/1.0.1/g' workloads/quarkus-rollouts-demo/kustomization.yaml

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Update to version 1.0.1"
git push
```

### Monitor the Rollout

Watch the rollout progress:

```shell
oc argo rollouts get rollout argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo -n argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo --watch
```

During each canary step, the AI analysis occurs:

1. Plugin sends analysis request to the Kubernetes agent
2. Agent fetches logs from stable and canary pods
3. Agent analyzes logs using the configured AI model
4. Agent returns a promote or abort recommendation
5. Rollout proceeds or aborts based on the analysis

View analysis results:

```shell
# List all analysis runs
oc get analysisrun -n argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo

# View specific analysis details
oc get analysisrun <name> -n argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo -o yaml
```

### Test Auto-Rollback

The sample application includes a failure mode that can be triggered via the UI. To test automatic rollback:

1. Start a new rollout by updating the application
2. Once the rollout begins, trigger errors in the canary pods using the UI slider
3. Watch as the AI agent detects the errors and aborts the rollout
4. The deployment automatically rolls back to the stable version

```shell
# Monitor the rollback
oc argo rollouts get rollout argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo -n argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo
```

To retry after fixing the issue:

```shell
oc argo rollouts retry rollout argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo -n argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo
```

## Configuration

### Plugin Registration

The AI metrics plugin is registered in the Argo Rollouts ConfigMap at [`system/progressive-delivery-controller/argo-rollouts-configmap.yaml`](system/progressive-delivery-controller/argo-rollouts-configmap.yaml):

```yaml
data:
  metricProviderPlugins: |-
    - name: argoproj-labs/metric-ai
      location: file:///home/argo-rollouts/rollouts-plugin-metric-ai
```

The plugin binary is included in the custom Argo Rollouts image specified in [`system/progressive-delivery-controller/rolloutmanager.yaml`](system/progressive-delivery-controller/rolloutmanager.yaml).

### Analysis Template

The AnalysisTemplate at [`workloads/quarkus-rollouts-demo/analysistemplate-ai-agent.yaml`](workloads/quarkus-rollouts-demo/analysistemplate-ai-agent.yaml) configures how the plugin analyzes deployments:

```yaml
spec:
  metrics:
    - name: ai-analysis
      provider:
        plugin:
          argoproj-labs/metric-ai:
            agentUrl: http://kubernetes-agent:8080
            stableLabel: role=stable
            canaryLabel: role=canary
            githubUrl: https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
            baseBranch: main
            extraPrompt: "Additional context for AI analysis"
```

### Agent Deployment

The Kubernetes agent runs as a separate service in the `openshift-gitops` namespace. Configuration is in [`system/kubernetes-agent/deployment.yaml`](system/kubernetes-agent/deployment.yaml). The agent requires RBAC permissions to access pod logs across namespaces.

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Loading

```shell
# Check ConfigMap configuration
oc get configmap argo-rollouts-config -n openshift-gitops -o yaml

# Check Rollouts controller logs
oc logs deployment/argo-rollouts -n openshift-gitops | grep -i plugin
```

### Agent Connection Issues

```shell
# Verify agent is running
oc get pods -n openshift-gitops | grep kubernetes-agent

# Check agent logs
oc logs deployment/kubernetes-agent -n openshift-gitops

# Test connectivity from Rollouts controller
oc exec -it deployment/argo-rollouts -n openshift-gitops -- \
  curl http://kubernetes-agent:8080/q/health
```

### Analysis Failures

```shell
# Check AnalysisTemplate configuration
oc get analysistemplate ai-analysis-agent -n argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo -o yaml

# Verify pod labels match selectors
oc get pods -n argo-rollouts-quarkus-demo --show-labels

# Check agent can access logs
oc logs deployment/kubernetes-agent -n openshift-gitops | grep -i "fetching logs"
```

### API Key Issues

```shell
# Verify secret exists and contains keys
oc get secret kubernetes-agent -n openshift-gitops -o yaml

# Check agent logs for authentication errors
oc logs deployment/kubernetes-agent -n openshift-gitops | grep -i "auth\|api key"
```

### Enable Debug Logging

```shell
# Enable debug logging for Rollouts controller
oc set env deployment/argo-rollouts LOG_LEVEL=debug -n openshift-gitops

# Enable debug logging for agent
oc set env deployment/kubernetes-agent QUARKUS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -n openshift-gitops

# View logs
oc logs -f deployment/argo-rollouts -n openshift-gitops
oc logs -f deployment/kubernetes-agent -n openshift-gitops
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Switching AI Models

Edit the agent secret to switch between Gemini and OpenAI:

```shell
oc edit secret kubernetes-agent -n openshift-gitops

# Restart agent to apply changes
oc rollout restart deployment/kubernetes-agent -n openshift-gitops
```

### Custom Analysis Prompts

Add application-specific context to improve analysis accuracy:

```yaml
extraPrompt: |
  This is a payment processing service.
  Focus on transaction errors and database connection issues.
  Temporary network errors during startup are acceptable.
  Ignore UI-related warnings.
```

### GitHub Integration

When configured with a GitHub URL and token, the agent can automatically create issues when deployments fail. Issues include:

- Detailed error analysis
- Log excerpts showing the problem
- Recommended remediation steps
- Links to relevant documentation
